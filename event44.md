#### Event 44

Event 44 appears on the map in southern Libya, but [is linked to deaths on the Greek-Macedonian border](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-macedonia-idUKKCN0WG0ZS?edition-redirect=uk). The location in the data file is listed as [Idomeni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idomeni), a Greek-Macedonian border town. The problem lies with the latitude, input as 21.1N. Although the longitude is correct at 22.5E, the latitude for Idomeni should be 41.1N, instead of 21.1N. The latter value places the event a full 20 degrees or about 1300 miles south of Idomeni, in Libya. This is likely a typo, where the first "2" should have been a "4."
