### Tracking migrant deaths

Every year, growing numbers of migrants have undertaken perilous overseas and overland crossings. The [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YNqIzyQfEn4i_be2GGWESnG2Q80E_fLASffsXdCOftI/edit#gid=1169253097) shown here were collected by the [The Migrant Files](http://www.themigrantsfiles.com/), an open-source academic enterprise in [data journalism](https://jplusplus.org/en/) which spearheaded the effort to track migrant deaths. Although the project was suspended in 2016, the [International Organization for Migration](https://gmdac.iom.int/map-tracking-migrant-deaths-and-disappearances) took up the mantle and continued [this work](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads).

This map is a distilled subset of deaths that were classified as drownings. The goal was to visualize the routes as well as the toll that sea crossings exact. 

Much of the data spans not just the Mediterranean itself, but continental Europe and northern Africa. While most of the locations appear valid, some are suspect. There are various reasons for this. Click on the tabs below the map for examples and more information.
